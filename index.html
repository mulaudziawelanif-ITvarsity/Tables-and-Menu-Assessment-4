            <h1>Welcome to my 25 highest grossing movies of all times</h1>
               <h2>Summary of one Movie</h2>
            <p>When Avengers: Endgame arrived in theaters in April 2019, box office insiders had no doubt it would be a hit—but few people had predicted just how big a dent the superhero movie would make in its opening weekend alone. The epic MCU team-up demolished all previous box office records by making a cool $1.2 billion in just its first few days in theaters. And within just a few months, it officially unseated James Cameron's Avatar—which had held the number one spot for 10 years—to become the highest-grossing movie of all time. But Avatar wasn't done yet.

                In March 2021, Avatar made a triumphant return to theaters in China, where it ended up grossing an impressive $3.5 million, bringing its total haul to just over $2.8 billion (and counting). It was a big enough number to catapult Avatar back to the top of the list.
                
                Will Avengers: Endgame attempt to reclaim its title as the world’s biggest movie ever? Only time will tell.</p>
